## Hi there Thuong here !. 

### 🧠 🧠This is my codeforces daily practice. 🤯🤯

### 💁‍♀️ I prepare link problem and solution  🙋

#### 💁‍♀️ You have clone and try this: With Python code , You must download `python` before running it ⭐️
#### 💁‍♀️ And if you using `Typescript code` must download package `ts-node` and running it. 😎
### 💁‍♀️ Else you choose C++ code you should have g++ <path_name_file> and rung ./a.out 

#### Happy Coding. Thanks 👨‍💻🎉
